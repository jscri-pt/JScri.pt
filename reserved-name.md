# **Description on Subdomain Reservation**

The act of reserving specific subdomains is a standard practice in the management of top-level domains and subdomains. This measure is taken to:

1. **Protect Brand and Reputation:** Keywords such as names of large companies (e.g., 'google', 'apple', 'microsoft') are reserved to prevent malicious use, like phishing or misrepresentation.
  
2. **Avoid Confusion:** Subdomains like 'mail', 'webmail', and 'api' are common standards and could lead to confusion if used by third parties.

3. **System Maintenance:** Some subdomains, such as 'ns1' to 'ns9', 'cdn', and 'assets', are reserved for the system's technical and operational purposes.

4. **Ensure Security:** Reserving keywords like 'login', 'account', 'billing', and 'invoice' prevents phishing attempts or scams.

5. **Prevent Misuse:** Names that could be misused or are highly sought-after (e.g., 'admin', 'test', 'alpha', 'beta') are reserved to avoid complications and potential conflicts.

# **Subdomain Reservation Policy**

The JScript subdomain reservation policy aims to ensure the integrity, security, and efficiency of our service. Below are the guidelines of this policy:

1. **Periodic Review:** This list of reserved subdomains is subject to periodic reviews. During these reviews, new subdomains may be added or removed.

2. **Additions without Notice:** JScript reserves the right to add new subdomains to the list at any time and without prior notice. This decision is based on operational needs, security concerns, and community feedback.

3. **Unblocking Request:** If an entity or individual wishes to use a reserved subdomain, they can request a review. JScript will analyze each request individually and may release the subdomain at its discretion, considering the associated risks and benefits.

4. **Usage Priority:** Subdomains indicated as "May be released under team review" have an additional layer of review. Releasing these subdomains is discretionary and will be decided on a case-by-case basis.

5. **Protection Against Misuse:** If an unreserved subdomain is used in a way that violates our usage policy, compromises security, or tarnishes JScript's reputation, it may be suspended or moved to the reserved list.

We thank all our users and partners for their understanding and reiterate our commitment to the security, reliability, and integrity of our services.
