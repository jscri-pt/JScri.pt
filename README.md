# JScri.pt

This repository is the central location for subdomain requests for the JavaScript community. You can request a JScri.pt subdomain for your project.

The purpose of this service is to provide friendly and memorable URLs for JavaScript community projects. The service is free and intended for open-source projects.

## How to request a subdomain

1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/jscri-pt/JScri.pt/issues/new) in this repository. The issue title should be the subdomain you are requesting. For example, if you want `my-project.JScri.pt`, the issue title should be `my-project`.

2. In the issue body, include a link to your project's website or GitHub repository.

3. We will review your request, which usually takes a few days. Once the request is accepted, we will set up the subdomain and respond to your issue confirming that everything is ready.

## Policy

- Only projects that are clearly related to JavaScript will be accepted.
- The content of the website must be non-commercial in nature.
